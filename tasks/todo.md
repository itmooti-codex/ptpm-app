# Task Checklist

Use this file for non-trivial work plans before implementation.

## Active Plan
- [ ] Define click-audit scope and runtime constraints for all `dev/` pages
- [ ] Add automated UI audit agent script and npm task
- [ ] Execute audit run against local Vite dev server
- [ ] Compile engineer-ready findings report (broken/missing behavior + evidence)
- [ ] Summarize residual risks and recommended next actions

## Notes
- Keep items small and testable.
- Mark items complete as each step is verified.
