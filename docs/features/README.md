## Contributing a Feature

When you build a significant new feature in a child app, document it using the template below and add it here. Then run `./scripts/sync-child.sh --all` to push it to all projects.

## Feature Doc Template

Every feature doc should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Feature Name

## Overview
One-paragraph description of what this feature does and why it's useful.

## Architecture
- How many files are involved
- High-level data flow (e.g., Frontend → Backend → External Service → Response)
- Key design decisions and why

## Files to Copy
List every file needed, grouped by layer:
- **Backend:** `server/src/routes/feature.ts`, ...
- **Frontend hooks:** `src/hooks/useFeature.ts`, ...
- **Frontend components:** `src/components/Feature.tsx`, ...
- **Stores:** `src/stores/useFeatureStore.ts`, ...
- **Types:** additions to `src/types/index.ts`

## Dependencies
npm packages to install (with versions if critical).

## Environment Variables
Any new env vars needed.

## Database Tables
SQL CREATE statements if applicable.

## Implementation Steps
Numbered steps to add this feature to a new app.

## Gotchas & Lessons Learned
Things that went wrong during development and how to avoid them.

## Example Usage
Key code snippets showing how the feature is used.
